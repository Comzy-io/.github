## Our Flagship Product: **Comzy Tunnel**

Meet **Comzy Tunnel** — our powerful tunneling tool that lets you **expose your local server to the internet** with just a single command. Think **ngrok**, but faster, lighter, and built with developers in mind.

### Use Comzy Tunnel to:
- Share local development servers with clients or teammates
- Test webhooks from external services
- Host temporary public endpoints for demos or quick API tests
